        <h1>Introduction</h1>
      
      <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">A realistic and visually accurate character animation necessitates proper skin deformation of the character models.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Skin deformation owes a large part to proper rigging of the characters.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The virtual skeleton forms the interface by which the animator can pose or animate the characters.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The joint-based skeleton has been very popular in the animation industry for many years and has nearly become a de facto standard.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Other technologies like inverse kinematics, forward kinematics, motion capture etc. are built on this hierarchical system of joints.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="Sentence" ann3="DRI_Background">It is plain to see why the joint-based skeleton system is thoroughly integrated into the current production pipeline in animation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="Sentence" ann3="DRI_Background">Where visual fidelity is of the utmost importance, with respect to film quality animation, a combination of techniques including muscle simulation is used to achieve the realistic best in mesh deformation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The attachment of mesh geometry to the underlying skeleton rig is called ‘skinning’ and this can be understood as a function mapping of the skeleton parameters to a deformation field.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">1 One of the common skinning methods in interactive systems is known by the following nomenclatures: sub-space deformation (SSD), smooth skinning, linear blend skinning and enveloping.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The process followed by this technique is to assign influence joints and blend weights to each vertex of the character.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Transforming the vertex by a weighted combination of the joints local coordinate frames completes skin computation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Challenge agreement="All_Equal">But in spite of computational performance and ease of use, the joint skeleton skinning is not without its share of problems, particularly where skin deformation is concerned.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge agreement="All_Equal">Unusual deformation artifacts appear in the skin while deforming.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge agreement="All_Equal">Some of the commonly seen problems in joint-based skinning during deformation are: candy wrapper effect during twist deformation and collapsing joints, which would create a rubber-tube like effect.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge agreement="All_Equal">There are certain solutions to circumvent these problems (which we will examine later in the paper) but they have their own drawbacks.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">Nevertheless, the joint-based system is popular owing to its interactivity and use of minimal animation data.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">More importantly, it is almost an integral part of the current animation workflow and animators are reluctant to abandon their familiar production practice.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Challenge">The relationship between a skeleton and the skin shape is highly non-linear.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Challenge">The problems of joint-based skeleton skinning mentioned above, in essence arises from under-sampling.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Challenge">The transformations of the two related joints are too far from each other.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Challenge">And with that low-rate sampling they fail to give a good approximation of the deformed skin surface.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution agreement="All_Equal">In this paper, we introduce a novel method called curve skeleton skinning, to overcome the persisting drawbacks of joint skeleton skinning.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Challenge_Goal ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge_Goal" ann3="DRI_Challenge_Goal">The basic idea is to represent the relationship between the skeletal movements and the skin deformation in a non-linear continuous fashion.</DRI_Challenge_Goal> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Approach">Since a lot of contemporary animation technology is built upon the hierarchical joint-skeleton based system, it is not wise to entirely replace the current practice.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">What we propose to do is to enhance the current joint skinning system using the curve skeleton skinning and retain the current animation production pattern that the animators are familiar with.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">While the joint skeleton is a discrete centre line representation of an object, the curve skeleton offers a continuous skeletal representation.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Thus a character will have two skeletons: the ordinary joint skeleton and a curve skeleton.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Outcome">The curve skeleton being continuous gives the maximum sampling rate and provides skin deformation transformation without any artifacts.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Challenge_Goal ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge_Goal" ann3="DRI_Challenge_Goal">In addition, we will demonstrate how the curve skeleton technique can drive muscle-based systems to achieve realistic muscle deformation during animation.</DRI_Challenge_Goal> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">Using our technique, the animator is able to work without digressing from the familiarity of the current joint-based system, but at the same time achieves maximum visual realism in terms of skin deformation.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Background">What needs pointing out is that the term curve skeleton has been used for other applications, such as virtual navigation, reduced-model formulation, visualization improvement, surface reconstruction and it was defined as ‘a 1D subset of the medial surface of a 3D object.</DRI_Background><DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">’ 2 Despite some similarity, it should not be confused with what we are presenting in this paper.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">One should neither confuse this with the inverse kinematics (IK) spline handle tool provided by the animation package Maya.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">Despite their seeming similarity, they are in essence very different techniques.</DRI_Challenge>

          <h2>Character Skinning</h2>
          <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Mesh deformations due to skeletal joint influence have undergone significant improvements in the recent years.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Some of the normal deformation techniques like free form deformations (FFDs) or lattices can be used in skin deformation techniques.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Singh and Kokkevis 3 demonstrate this in their paper.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">They use surface-oriented FFDs for skinning.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">An interactive deformation technique for complex geometric objects using curves or wires is detailed in Reference [ 4 ].</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">There are basically two main approaches to modeling skin deformations, namely, anatomy-based approach and skin-shape based approach (e.g., example-based skinning).</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The anatomical approach derives its name from its implementation using anatomical models of muscles and skeletons and other relevant interior structures.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">These modules undergo deformation when the body moves and a skin simulation and collision detection algorithm is run which would realistically deform the skin where and whenever it is required.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Reference [ 5 ] details a technique of efficient muscle shape deformation using the anatomical skin deformation technique.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Reference [ 5 ] resorts to the creation of a muscle model, which is categorized into two layers: an action line and a surface mesh.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Basically, the action line is the mechanism that drives the deformation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">They also implement attractive and repulsive force fields in the form of ellipsoid metaballs to stabilize the action line.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Simulation of complex dynamics and performing complex collisions and also providing a visually realistic output form the main strength of the anatomical approach.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Incorporating physical properties of anatomy structures can potentially improve realism.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Physics can be used either at the muscle level 6 or used to help character rigging.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">7 Reference [ 8 ] presents another approach to deformation using an elastic surface layer model.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">It uses a layered structure of anatomical parts from the inside out, skeleton-&gt;bone-&gt;fat-&gt;skin.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The surface is discretized and finite differencing techniques are used to evolve the deformation through time.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The drawback comes in the form of computation expense.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The anatomy-based approach is therefore used mainly in high-quality film visual effects where anatomical accuracy is a must for believable computer generated characters.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The example-based approach forms a suitable alternative where computational expenses are to be minimized.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">This method takes an interpolative approach to deformation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">An artist models certain key poses of the characters where a correlation is maintained for the degrees of freedom, in this case, it would be the joint positions or rotational angles.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">New poses are interpolated from these key poses.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">A modified least square fitting technique is used to compute the weights of the deformation and the subsequent generalization of skin movement to other animated poses.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">In Reference [ 9 ] the algorithm is trained in a statistical manner so that deformation computation for an arbitrary animated pose can be done.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">They use a technique called multiweight enveloping in place of single-weight enveloping for better deformation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Reference [ 10 ] also implements an example-based approach to deforming meshes by using radial basis functions to supply the interpolation weights and also for shape interpolation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">A variation of example-based approach where key example poses are derived from arbitrary unrelated examples is detailed in Reference [ 11 ] where a range scan is used.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Thus example-based approaches have the advantage over anatomical approaches by being computationally faster and also due to the fact that creating example poses are much easier compared to creating detailed anatomically correct models.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Most of the described techniques are built upon the existing hierarchical skeletal joint system and modify 10 or even create 9,12 new weight calculations to rectify any sort of physical artifacts in the skin deformation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The example-based approach relies on key sample poses to derive a generalization of deformation, and this becomes a major disadvantage, as this in itself is an expensive and time-consuming process.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">It is not desirable to create many examples and train the system.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Approach">Our approach builds upon the existing system using the curve skeleton for a continuous sampling of the skin surface thereby facilitating skin deformations devoid of geometry artifacts.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">Since our technique falls in between the two approaches, seamless integration with the two is also possible and becomes its strong advantages.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Approach">A relevant technique to ours is the sweep-based skinning.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Approach">13 The body of a character is segmented with a large number of sweep planes which will be transformed by the joint skeleton.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Approach">These planes are used to guide the transformation of every skin point during animation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">With our method, the skin surface does not need to be approximated by sweep surfaces.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">It will be deformed directly by the underlying curve skeleton, leading to a simpler process.</DRI_Approach>

          <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Challenge" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">Skeleton and skin relationship in the present production pipeline is strictly linear, whereas observation of the various geometry artifacts like candy wrapper and collapsing joints intuitively point to the fact that linear blending or skeletal space deformation falls short in accurately depicting skin deformations because of their non-linear nature.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Challenge" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Background">This non-linear nature is explored in Reference [ 12 ] where a spherical blending is proposed.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Only the translation factor is most commonly used for the skin vertices and the rotation factor is not considered.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Background">It is our knowledge that the problem reduces after weight painting only when the joint influence fall-off follows a curve pattern.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Wang and Philips 9 introduce a multiweight technique to eliminate this problem in a normal joint-based skeleton skinning.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">However, this requires the generation of a large number of pre-modeled examples in the first place.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">The solution to the collapsing joints problem, which is to place additional joints 1,14 (placing additional joints is basically bringing a curve nature to the joint chain) near the main joint, has the added problems of: (1) creating a new joint in the hierarchy; (2) joint connections have to be done again to connect the new joint in the existing chain; and (3) painting of weights have to be adjusted to accommodate the new joint.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">With our curve skeleton technique, the curve serves as a duplicated skeleton to the actual underlying joint skeleton.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Effectively any point on the curve can be considered as a joint.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">In other words, the skeleton is equipped with an infinite number of joints, which will influence the skin deformation.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">The curve nature of the skeleton makes it easier to manipulate it with a great order of flexibility.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">The idea to use a curve skeleton side by side with the traditional joint skeleton is conceptually simple and functionally efficient giving realistic skin deformations even under extreme mesh duress.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome">Our curve skeleton technique takes full advantage of the nonlinearity of the skeleton-skin relationship.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution>

          <h2>Linear Linkage (Joint WithT wo Links)</h2>
          <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">In a linear linkage the centre of the joint gives the first control point (CP) of the curve.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Then one Bone_CP each is inserted on the opposite sides of the Joint_CP ( Figure 1a ).</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Both Bone_CPs have floating positions along the two neighbouring bones, its position being constrained by the angle between the two bones.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The reason for the floating position is to eliminate the selfintersection of the skin mesh ( Figure 1 -a1).</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Before we can predict the exact movement of the Bone_CP, first we should estimate the approximate distance d from the skin surface to the relevant link of the skeleton.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The condition for non-self-intersection is to check if the local radius of curvature r at the joint is not less than d.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">If we analyse the curve function, we can extract the exact expression from the position of Bone_CP, but because the distance d is only an approximate result, it may not fit exactly in the animation.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">So here the floating position of the Bone_CP is left to the animator to define interactively ( Figure 1 -a2).</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">By providing the animator with more parameters, which he/she can tweak, we grant flexibility and freedom to adjust the animation.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">One curve is generated.</DRI_Approach>
          
            
            Figure 1. Three types of skeleton topology: (a) linear linkage structure, it shows a schematic diagram of the curve skeleton with the Bone_CPs inserted on the two sides of the Joint_CP; (a1) shows the curve skeleton within the actual skin mesh, the white crosshairs denote the Bone_CP which is placed to avoid mesh self-intersection; (a2) shows the Floating Bone_CP, the pink line denotes the curve skeleton, the joint skeleton is shown in green, the Bone_CPs on either side of the Joint_CP changes position as the joint angle varies. (b) Bifurcation linkage structure, it shows the schematic blow-up of the abdomen area of the skin model. Here we can see that there are three curves for the linkage. (c) Cross linkage structure, it shows the schematic blow-up of the neck area of the skin model. Here we can see that there are two curves for the linkage.

          <h2>Local Frame Def|nition</h2>
          <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Similar to the joint-based skeleton, each point on the curve in a curve skeleton has a local frame (similar to a Frenet frame) defining the space transformation sampled at that point.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">This local frame is a function of the parameter t of the curve point.</DRI_Approach> <Sentence agreement="All_Equal">The frame on the curve can be defined in two phases: (i) For the local frame of the point associated with original joints in the joint skeleton.</Sentence> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">These points normally form the curve segment endings.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">They can be easily found from the curve definition.</DRI_Approach> <Sentence agreement="All_Equal">At these points, the local frame is defined from the related joint’s local coordinate axis: the x-axis x 0 is the tangent direction at that point on the curve ( Figure 2a ) Then the y 0 and z 0 can be determined by ( Figure 2 ) y 0 1⁄4 z Â x 0 z 0 1⁄4 x 0 Â y 0 (1Þ (ii) For the local frame at any point inside the curve segment: This can be calculated by using the frames at the two endings to perform a linear interpolation.</Sentence>

          An important feature of the local frame is the centre of the local coordinate system.</Sentence> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">If the centre is lying on the curve, the deformed skin will move out from underneath the skeleton.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The underlying structures like muscles or bones will be exposed.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">So here the centre of the local frame is translated on to the original skeleton shown in Figure 2b .</DRI_Approach>

          <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">When the bone twists around its local x-axis, it will not have any effect on the associated curve skeleton.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">This is not acceptable.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">In order to remedy this problem, here on the curve skeleton we define two extra attributes, twist angle and twist distribution.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The twist angle can be easily queried from the associated joint.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The rotation angle is for the curve ending.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">For each point on the curve, we still need a twist distribution to define how the curve twists along its path.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Normally it is not evenly distributed as can be seen from the twist of a forearm.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">In order to perform even distribution of twisting, we provide the animator with the freedom to control how the curve twists by manipulating the distribution curve.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The distribution curve ( Figure 3a ) is very much like the animation curves in Maya.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Here the twist angle is distributed along the distribution curve so that the twisting is smooth and natural.</DRI_Approach>

        <h1>Skinning</h1>
        
          <h2>Binding Skin to the Curve Skeleton</h2>
          <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The process of skin binding is to transform each skin surface point hx,y,zi at the binding pose to the local frame coordinate system hi, t, u, di, where i is the index to the specified curve segment, t is the parameter along that curve segment, u is the rotation angle around the x-axis from the y-axis, d is the distance from the local frame centre.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Actually the triple parameter ht, u, di may be considered as being expressed in a cylindrical coordinate system.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The values ht, u, di can be easily computed if we can settle the associated curve segment.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Thus the challenging part of the work is to find the associated curve segment, and assign the weighting parameter for each curve segment—skin binding.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Background">There is a lot of work 16 associated with the traditional joint-based method, like the containment-binding algorithm, point-to-line mapping, Delaunay tetrahedralization.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The relevant default weight factors w i of a skin point for the ith curve segment is determined by the distance between the skin point concerned with the relevant curve segments.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">If a skin point is related with only one curve, which represents the majority of cases, the weight factor is always 1.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">For those skin points associated with two curve segments, the default weights are proportional to the distances to the relevant curve segments, that is, the further away a skin point is from the curve segment, the smaller the weight is.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">This is also the case for any skin points associated with three curve segments.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">In all cases, the summation of the weights are constrained to one, P w i 1⁄4 1.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The animator will have freedom to edit the weighting factors in the same way as the smooth skinning.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">Given that we have a maximum of only three curve segments for each skin point, weight assignment for a skin point is simpler than the traditional smooth skinning method and the computation for skin deformation is computationally cheaper.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Approach">Smooth skinning usually involves three weights for each skin point and in many cases there could be as many as five weights.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Approach">This is worsened if additional joints are placed in order to remedy the unpleasant artefacts.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Approach">The more the joints, the trickier it is to determine the weight distribution.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">With our curved skeleton, this problem will almost certainly not arise.</DRI_Outcome>
        
        
          <h2>Deforming the Skin With the Curve Skeleton</h2>
          <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Once the skin is bound with the curve skeleton, deforming the skin is pretty straightforward.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The local coordinates of each skin surface point are transformed with the associated local frame to obtain the new position in the world coordinate system.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">So the new point P, is defined by X P 1⁄4 w i M ði;tÞ P Lðu;dÞ (3) i where w i is the weight for the specific curve segment i, M (i,t) is the new transformation matrix at the parameter t position along the curve segment i.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Outcome">As discussed earlier, we use on average a smaller number of weights.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Outcome">This leads to a smaller number of summation terms needed for the calculation of the deformed skin points (see Equation (3)).</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome">As a result, our computation speed is at the same order, but is slightly faster than that of the traditional smooth skinning technique.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution>

        <h1>Conclusion and Future Work</h1>
        <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Skin deformation is closely linked with the movement of the skeleton of a character.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Challenge">It is understandable that the relationship between both is highly non-linear, which poses a challenge if the relationship is to be modeled mathematically correctly.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">Existing skeletondriven techniques regard it as a much-simplified linear problem, which however, has resulted in unrealistic skin deformation in certain regions of the character body.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">In this paper we have presented a technique, known as the curve skeleton based skinning, by considering it as a proper non-linear problem.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome">The main advantage of this technique is its consistency with the current animation production practice and the ability to overcome the undesirable drawbacks of skeleton-driven skinning.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome">From the algorithmic point of view, the technique reduces a level of complexity in the skinning and deformation.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">By layering the curve skeleton on top of the existing joint skeleton, we allow the animator to work conventionally (as in a joint-based system) and yet receive good results.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">Through a combination of existing practices and newly designed ones, we have successfully created a fusion, which maximizes the efficiency of surface deformation during animation.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">For an articulated character, we use no more than three weights for any skin point.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">In fact, for the majority of cases, there is only one weight, which is 1, to be is used.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">In comparison with the traditional smooth skinning technique that usually requires on average 3–5 weights, our computation speed is faster.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Background">One should not confuse the curve skeleton technique with the inverse kinematics (IK) spline handle tool provided by the animation package Maya.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Background">Despite their seeming similarity, the objective of the Maya IK spline handle tool is to control the joint positions using a spline.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Background">Skin deformation is achieved using the traditional smooth skinning technique.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">Our curve skeleton is controlled by the joints of a character.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">The skin is directly deformed by the curve skeleton.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">The Maya plug-in implementation of the curve skeleton technique has given satisfactory results.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome">One of the main advantages of the curve skeleton skin deformation technique is that, the curve skeleton needs not necessarily be placed on the underlying joint skeleton.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">With a slight modification utilizing a linear mapping of curve points to the joint skeleton, the plug-in can make use of a displaced curve skeleton which would be useful for subtle deformation on anatomical areas like the armpits.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Unspecified ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Unspecified" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">The results of the Maya plug-in can be seen in Figures 4–7.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">Our current implementation allows both skin and muscle deformation to be modeled within a unified framework.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_FutureWork agreement="All_Equal">As future work, we will further improve the skinning realism by adding the fat effect.</DRI_FutureWork> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_FutureWork">Fat usually deposits between the skin and the muscles.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_FutureWork">Effective realism occurs when the skin actually slides over the fat.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_FutureWork">This is especially true in the areas near joints where acute deformation happens.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Turner and Thalmann 8 defines the fat layer as a thickness specified at each point on the skin surface and make use of reaction constraints to push the skin the required distance out from the underlying layers.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Yang and Zhang 18 devises a fast method for simulating fat in which a fat bulge distribution function is described.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">They have used a geometric method instead of resorting to a physical simulation method, and gives convincing results without the computational expense of physical simulation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_FutureWork ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_FutureWork" ann3="DRI_FutureWork">With a small modification, the fat bulge effect can be made even in a curve skeleton-based skinning.</DRI_FutureWork> <DRI_FutureWork ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_FutureWork" ann3="DRI_FutureWork">The function can be defined under the local frame of the curve skeleton.</DRI_FutureWork> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">In the present context, since the skeleton is a curve, distribution and deformation can be linked with the tangent angle at a given number of curve points around the joints.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Background">As fat is largely incompressible, when a joint bends, flesh between the adjacent bones will be squeezed, producing bulges immediately near the joint and at the sides.</DRI_Background> <DRI_FutureWork ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_FutureWork" ann3="DRI_FutureWork">Using curve tangents will provide for an accurate distribution in any given time frame because of the integrated results from the sample multiple curve points.</DRI_FutureWork>
