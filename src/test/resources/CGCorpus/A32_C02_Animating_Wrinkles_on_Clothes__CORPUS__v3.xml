          <h2>3.3 Explanations</h2>
          <Sentence agreement="All_Equal">Following rather abstract and mathematical derivation in the previous subsection, we would like to point out and discuss some properties of the algorithm we have presented so far:
          • The algorithm is computationally inexpensive during animation, as the only quantities that have to be determined for each triangle are the elements a , b , d of the inverse deformation matrix and the resulting modulation factor by using the formula given by equation 5.</Sentence> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">The wrinkling coefficients on the other hand, are computationally expensive.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">However, as one can see from equation 11 in Appendix A, they depend only on quantities that are known prior to entering the animation loop and can therefore be calculated once at the beginning.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">• As we have pointed out in the discussion so far, we have derived an algorithm that is based on the area conservation property.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Unspecified" ann3="DRI_Approach">Here we explain the role played by the area conservation property in our work.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">From a mathematical point of view, it is clear that we have presented a solution within the approximation of small deformations.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">There are several possibilities to deal with this restriction.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">One could decide to restrict the simulations to small deformations where the approximation is valid and/or take into account the higher order terms in the series expansion to extend the range of validity of the approximation.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Instead, we propose a pragmatic approach.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified ann2="DRI_Unspecified" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">We declare that equation 5 describes the overall wrinkling behavior only.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">This frees us conceptually from the “burden of mathematical correctness”.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">This is because, we are more concerned with the visual results of the animation, rather than precise area conservation.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Moreover, the deformations during cloth simulation are moderate in general.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Hence, higher order terms in the expansion may become significant but not predominant.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The modulation factor h is a function of the deformation of triangle and has value around one.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">If the triangle is net compressed, h will be greater than one.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">For the elongation, it will be less than one.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">One can scale, translate and clip it to introduce a finer control required for the animation.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Note that this transformation of the modulation factor no longer satisfies the area conservation property.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Also, Section 4 introduces a modulation map, which further violates area conservation.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">• Another very important property of our algorithm is that it is local.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">By local, we mean that wrinkling effects caused by deformations are confined to the deformed areas.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">This is crucial to obtain realistic wrinkling.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">For example, a garment wrinkles around the shoulder of an animated character as she lifts her arm, while it is stretched on the corresponding side.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Locality is introduced in our algorithm by working on a per triangle basis.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The size of the mesh triangles actually governs the extension of local wrinkling effects.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">• Wrinkling coefficients are sensitive to the wrinkle function and therefore to the wrinkle patterns.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Wrinkling coefficients for two different patterns on the same triangle will generally differ.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">Therefore, the same deformation applied to a triangle will yield two different modulation factors (one for each pattern).</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">Each pattern, for instance, features a “principal wrinkling direction”.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">Assume that the wrinkling patterns are orthogonal to each other.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">Then, a deformation in the orthogonal direction of one pattern will result in a smaller modulation factor as compared to a modulation factor for the other pattern.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">In other words, the direction of the deformation “favors one pattern over the other”.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">This property can be used for developing multi-fold wrinkling techniques.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Section 4.1 describes a multi-fold wrinkling implementation.</DRI_Unspecified>
