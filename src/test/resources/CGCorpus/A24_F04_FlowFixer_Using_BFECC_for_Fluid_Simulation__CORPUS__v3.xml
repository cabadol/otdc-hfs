      <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Challenge">Simulation of incompressible fluid involves several computation steps including diffusion, advection and pressure projection.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">Advection steps transport some quantities from one region to another along the fluid’s velocity field.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Challenge_Goal ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge_Goal" ann3="DRI_Challenge_Goal">In this paper, we explore four forms of advection encountered in fluid simulation: velocity, smoke density, image and level set advections.</DRI_Challenge_Goal> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Approach">Velocity advection transports the velocity field along the velocity itself.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Approach">This step is always needed in nonsteady flow simulation based on Navier-Stokes equation.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Approach">Smoke density advection transports smoke along the velocity field.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Challenge">Sometimes, we may want to advect a colored image, which may be considered as colored smoke.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Approach">We call this process image advection.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Challenge">When one uses a level set method [OS88] to simulate a free surface or a two-phase flow, for example a water surface simulation, the level set must be transported as well.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Approach">We call it level set advection.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Approach">Those advection steps can be computed by an upwind or a semi-Lagrangian method.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">The latter is often preferred due to its stability for large time step.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">The first order semi-Lagrangian method is popular in computer animation because of its simplicity.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">However, the first order semiLagrangian contains a significant amount of numerical diffusion and dissipation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">In velocity advection, it yields damped fluid motion.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">In smoke density advection, it leads to a premature dilution of smoke, and is not able to simulate pure advec- tion.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Background">Therefore, higher order schemes, such as WENO or CIP [ TFK ∗ 03 ], are desired.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Challenge_Goal">We show that the implementation complexity of these schemes may be easily avoided by adding a very simple Back and Forth Error Compensation and Correction (BFECC) to an existing first order semiLagrangian schemes, thus improving its space and time accuracy to second order.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Challenge_Goal">We show that this approach reduces velocity damping and smoke density dilution and demonstrate its benefits on the four forms of advections discussed previously.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">BFECC was recently proposed in [DL03, DL04] as a level set interface computation method.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">As is mentioned in [ELF05], high order methods may not prevent volume loss much.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">However, the authors of [DL03] combined BFECC with their simple redistancing technique and applied it to the Zalesak’s problem, showing significantly reduced the volume loss.</DRI_Background> <Sentence agreement="All_Equal">In the level set framework, the one with smallest volume error would be the particle level set method [EMF02, ELF05] In this paper, we focus on applying BFECC to velocity and smoke advection steps rather than level set advection.</Sentence> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We, however, use BFECC and the simple redistancing for level set advection of various fluid simulations and show that sufficiently realistic fluid animation can be obtained.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_FutureWork" ann3="DRI_Approach">It would be interesting to apply this to the level set advection part of the particle level set method [ELF05] for more demanding simulation.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The stability problems in the earlier works such as [ FM96 ] were successfully remedied in [ Sta99 ] by introducing the pressure projection scheme to enforce incompressibility of the fluid and the semi-Lagrangian treatment of the advection term in the Navier-Stoke equation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">This solution is popular for the simulation of incompressible Fluids, such as smoke [ FSJ01 ] and also for more challenging free surface flows [ FF01 , EMF02 ].</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The semi-Lagrangian velocity advection [Sta99] comes with built-in dissipation, i.e., the velocity is dissipated quickly since the linear interpolation in the first order semiLagrangian produces large error.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Challenge">While higher order interpolation can solve the problem, it involves more neighboring grid point values and increases the complexity, particularly when non-uniform mesh structures are used.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">In [FSJ01], vorticity is added to generate small scale fluid rolling motion.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Recently, [ SSK05 ] addressed this built-in dissipation by enhancing advection itself.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">They adopted the CIP [ TFK ∗ 03 ] method that increases the order of accuracy in space by introducing the derivatives of velocity to build a sub-cell velocity profile.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">A nice feature of this CIP method is that it is local in the sense that only the grid point values of one cell are used in order to update a point value.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">However, in this CIP method, all components of velocity and their partial derivatives should be advected, increasing the implementation complexity and computation time, especially in 3D.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">It is also worth noting that CIP has higher order accuracy in space only.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Therefore high order integration of characteristics is also necessary.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">In contrast, BFECC is easier to implement and exhibits second order accuracy both in space and time and is local during each of its operational steps.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Song et al [ SSK05 ] focused on applying CIP to generate more dynamic water surface behavior.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Challenge_Hypothesis">However, we believe that having less dissipative and diffusive advection provides significant benefits in smoke simulations as well.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Unspecified ann2="DRI_Unspecified" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">This is illustrated in the middle five images of Fig. 4 , where large amount of dissipation makes the smoke look very dark.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Background">In contrast, when BFECC is used, the smoke keeps full brightness throughout the simulation as is shown in the last five images.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The introduction of the level set method to fluid animation in [ FF01 ] allowed realistic simulation of fluids with complex free surfaces.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The problem left here was the volume loss in the level set method and the solution, known as the particle level set method, proposed subsequently in [ EMF02 ], turned out to be very successful in volume preservation.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">The two phase fluid solver using variable density projection has been broadly studied in mathematics and fluid mechanics [ SSO94 , OKBG00 , HKLS04 ].</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">It has been used in graphics applications by [ HK03 ], where the authors simulated air bubbles rising and merging and by [TFK ∗ 03, SSK05], where splash style interactions between water surface and air are studied.</DRI_Background>

The next five are without BFECC, where the dissipation/diffusion in the semi-Lagrangian step deteriorate the density of smoke. The last five images simulated with BFECC show minimal dissipation/diffusion and the smoke is in full density throughout the simulation. Notice that all simulation parameters are exactly same except for the usage of BFECC in smoke advection. Therefore the only difference is the density of smoke. Also, notice that the simulation time differs by less than 1% since it is dominated by the pressure projection step.

        5. Results
        
          Figure 6: The far left image shows an air bubble placed in olive oil at time zero. The next three images are first order semi-Lagrangian implementation of level set advection. The next three images are produced using BFECC and simple redistancing, showing significantly reduced volume loss.

        <Sentence agreement="All_Equal">w is the velocity vector for redistancing.</Sentence> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">This equation can be solved by applying first order upwinding in discretizing the term w · ∇φ .</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">An alternative is the semi-Lagrangian style integration, i.e., φ n+1 = φ n (x − w∆ τ ) + sgn( φ n )∆ τ , where x is the location of each grid point.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Hence, φ n (x − w∆ τ ) is the φ value of previous location.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Outcome">When these integration formulae for (6) are combined with BFECC, the redistancing tends to spoil good φ values computed from the second order accurate BFECC.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Outcome">This leads to the idea of turning redistancing off near the interface to keep good φ values there.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Background">The conditions to turn off redistancing is provided in [DL03], where the significant enhancement were shown for the Zalesak’s problem.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Background">This simple redistancing is crucial in preserving volume [DL03].</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">It is also easy to implement since it simply requires to perform redistancing at the points where at least one of the following two conditions are met.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">• When the grid point is not close to the interface, i.e., when φ i, j has the same sign with its eight neighbors.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="Sentence" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">• When the slope is sufficiently high, i.e., when | φ i, j − φ i±1, j | or | φ i, j − φ i, j±1 | ≥ 1.1∆x.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We test BFECC in different fluid simulations.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We simulate air-water and olive oil-air interactions.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified ann2="DRI_Unspecified" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">Properties of these fluids are provided in Table 1 .</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Water is rendered as bluish surface and olive oil is rendered in yellowish color.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We use PovRay ( http://povray.org ) to render images.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified ann2="DRI_Unspecified" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">In Fig. 7 , we simulated a cup, air and water interaction.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">The cup is released upside down near the water surface.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">Due to its weight, the cup sinks deep into water but it soon rise again because of the air in it.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">However, in the top, we turned BFECC off for velocity advection and hence the water became dissipative, preventing the cup from tumbling.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">In the bottom, we use BFECC for velocity advection, where the velocity dissipation is small and hence the cup can tumble 180 degree.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">This example indicates that reducing velocity dissipation could be important in simulating fluid and rigid body interaction.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">We implement the rigid fluid method [CMT04] to simulate rigid body and fluid interaction in Fig. 1 and 7.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We use multiple pressure projections to address the seeping problem mentioned in [CMT04].</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">The computation time varies in situations such as the complexity of fluid motions.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">In simple bubble rising situation without rigid body, it took a few seconds per time step using a 50 3 mesh.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">The cup example in Fig. 7 has multiple pressure projections and it took about 30 to 130 seconds per time step on a 70 3 grid.</DRI_Outcome>

          Figure 7: Simulation of a sinking cup. The top row is simulated without the BFECC in velocity advection, where the cup fails to tumble. The bottom row is simulated with BFECC and the cup tumbles thanks to the reduced damping in velocity field.
