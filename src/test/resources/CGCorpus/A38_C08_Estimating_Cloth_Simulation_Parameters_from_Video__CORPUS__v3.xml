        <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Cloth modeling has a long history, dating back to work in the textile community from the mid-1930s by Peirce 27 .</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Work on cloth modeling in computer graphics has focused on developing dynamic simulation techniques that are both realistic and fast.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Baraff and Witkin describe a cloth model that uses stiff springs with implicit time integration 4 .</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">This model was subsequently adapted to reduce the over-damping due to implicit integration 9 .</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Explicit time integration approaches 18 use weaker springs for stretching and shearing, often explicitly limiting the amount of stretching 29 , 6 .</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Choi and Ko introduced a bending energy model that more accurately captures the fine creases and bends of cloth 9 .</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Lahey provides a comprehensive overview of cloth hysteresis models from the perspective of computational fabric mechanics 23 .</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Extensive work has also been done on modeling collisions and friction.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Cloth self-collision is handled either by untangling the cloth 37 , 39 , 3 or by preemptively avoiding collisions 30 , 20 , 6 .</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Various potential field methods have been used for general collision detection and response 33 , 32 .</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Despite this large body of work on cloth simulation models, little work has appeared in the computer graphics literature on estimating the parameters of these models so that they match the behavior of real fabrics.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Cloth parameter estimation has been studied in the textile community (for an overview, see Breen and colleagues 17 ), but such methods have not yet enjoyed wide-spread use in the computer graphics community.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">An important exception is the work by Breen 5 who used the Kawabata system 22 to measure bending, shearing, and tensile parameters by subjecting a swatch of fabric to a series of mechanical tests and measuring the force needed to deform it into a standard set of shapes.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Although the Kawabata system can provide accurate measurements, these measurements are problematic for computer graphics cloth simulation problems for two reasons.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">First, there might not be a direct and simple mapping between the parameters for a particular cloth model and the Kawabata parameters.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Second, the Kawabata system does not measure dynamic cloth parameters, e.g. air drag or damping, which are of key importance for moving cloth.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">One promising approach for modeling cloth parameters is to automatically search for parameters that match real, observed cloth.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Jojic and Huang fit parameters of a particlebased cloth model to fit a range scan of real cloth in a static rest configuration, draped over a sphere 21 .</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">More challenging still, they attacked the problem of measuring the 3D geometry of an object from the resting shape of a piece of cloth draped over it, a problem that we do not consider in this paper.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">However, Jojic and Huang did not treat the problem of measuring dynamic parameters or demonstrate accurate results across a range of fabric types.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">More distantly related are techniques for computing the geometry of cloth from images.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Coarse estimates of the time-varying geometry of cloth can be computed using traditional stereo matching techniques by using two or more cameras and treating each time instant independently (see Scharstein and Szeliski 31 for an overview).</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">More accurate results may be obtained by projecting structured light patterns on the cloth (see Zhang et al. 40 for an overview).</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Challenge_Hypothesis">Rather than computing shape at every time instant independent from the next, it can be advantageous to integrate images over time to improve accuracy.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Two examples of promising work along these lines are Carceroni and Kutulakos 8 and Torresani et al. 34 ; both studies demonstrated reconstructions of moving cloth.</DRI_Background>

        <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">In this section, we report the results of simulation parameters obtained using our technique applied to four fabrics: linen, fleece, satin and knit.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We measured the mass and dimensions of the fabrics.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We also accurately measure the position of the two top corners using a Vicon motion capture system.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We compute the projection matrices for the camera and projector using a calibration grid comprising of several motion capture markers.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We performed two trials per experiment, each with slightly different initial conditions and optimized on the first 50 frames of video in each trial.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">Each trial took approximately 50 hours to converge on a 2.8GHz Intel Xeon processor (approximately 600 iterations of simulated annealing).</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">For this reason, we started the optimizations on the two trials (per fabric) with the same initial guess and chose parameters (optimized) that minimized the total error on the two trials.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Static test.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We perform optimization on two trials for each fabric; the results are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 .</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The two trials have different separation distances between the top corners.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">For each fabric, we optimize for six parameters: stiffness and damping parameters for stretch, shear, and bend.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The air drag parameters were fixed for this experiment to the mid point of their range of values.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The initial values for the two trials are obtained from a coarse exhaustive search (four values per parameter).</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified ann2="DRI_Unspecified" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">The initial values and final values of the estimated parameters are summarized in Table 1 .</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Figs. 8 and 9 show a very good visual match between the simulations with their counterpart real fabrics.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">However, there is a significant disparity in the final optimized values from the two trials.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">In order to understand this disparity, we performed a set of optimizations (on a single fabric) with very similar initial values.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Table 2 shows the parameter values for satin from five optimizations where the initial conditions were randomly varied by ±5%.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Outcome

agreement="All_Equal">We get consistent estimates for parameters that have lower variability (e.g., bend, stretch).</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">Parameters with high variability are estimated poorly, because their values do not contribute sufficiently to the error.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">This result is consistent with our intuition that static tests cannot be used to estimate dynamic parameters like stretch and shear damping or air drag and motivates the waving test, which excites both the static and waving parameters.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Waving test.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We optimize for nine parameters in the waving test: the six cloth stiffness and damping parameters and three air drag parameters ( Fig. 10 ).</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">As with the static test, we initialize the static parameters in this test from a coarse exhaustive search.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The dynamic parameters were initialized using a random guess.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We optimized on the first 50 frames of the sequence.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified ann2="DRI_Unspecified" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">The initial values and final values of the optimized parameters for two trials are reported in Table 3 .</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">The final values of the parameters from the two trials differ in part because the variability of the parameters is still fairly high ( Fig. 11 ).</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_FutureWork" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">Different motions or larger sequence might further reduce the variability of the parameters.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">We choose the parameter set that minimizes the sum of the error from the two trials.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Unspecified" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">For instance, in the following example of fleece waving, we choose the parameters from experiment 2.</DRI_Outcome> <Sentence agreement="All_Equal">Error: Exp 1 Error: Exp 2 Total Error Pars: Exp 1 4257.2 10913.5 15170.7

ann1="DRI_FutureWork" ann3="DRI_Approach">However, we believe that a more general solution for parameter identification using our framework is to simultaneously optimize across multiple trials of different experiments.</DRI_FutureWork> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Optimization progress.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Fig. 12 shows the static shape of the

ann2="DRI_Unspecified" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">These two figures show the progress of the optimization and indicate that the minimum corresponds to a visually compelling match.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Metric validation.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">We compare each of the four optimized angle maps from simulation (corresponding to the four fabrics) with the four angle maps computed from video.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">In Fig. 14 , each curve shows one fabric (e.g., fleece) compared with four simulations, corresponding to each fabric type.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Unspecified" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">We see that each fabric in simulation has a minimum error when compared to its counterpart in reality.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Fig. 14 also demonstrates that our approach could be potentially useful for recognizing different types of fabrics in video.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Generalization.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">We evaluated the parameters obtained from optimization on longer sequences (150 frames).</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified agreement="All_Equal">Fig. 10 and the accompanying videos show a good visual match between corresponding frames in simulation and video.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Unspecified ann2="DRI_Unspecified" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">All videos are available off our web page and/or included in the DVD.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Unspecified ann2="DRI_Unspecified" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">The videos also show that the parameters obtained from optimization generalize well on new sequences.</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We also validated the estimated parameters on a long sequence actuated by a robot ( Fig. 15 ).</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We used a a Mitsubishi PA-10 robot arm to move the corner point along a simple sinusoidal trajectory, thereby ensuring that we had the same input motion across different fabrics.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Finally, we used the optimized parameters to simulate a skipping motion of a human actor wearing a skirt ( Fig. 16 ).</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Approach">Here, the actor repeats the same skipping motion (approximately) for the four different skirts.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We used data from a full body optical motion capture of the actor performing the same skipping motion (in another trial) to drive the character for the cloth simulation.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">The results show that the parameters obtained from our optimization approach approximately capture the static shape and dynamic properties of skirts of different materials.</DRI_Outcome>

          Table 2: Performance of simulated annealing on several optimizations. All the optimizations start with values which are within ±5% of the initial values given in the first row. Parameters with high variability (e.g., stretch damping) are estimated poorly and vary significantly across the different optimizations. However, parameters with low variability (e.g., bend) are consistent across multiple optimizations.

Similarly, point 2 is the error when the satin simulation is compared with real satin. The four curves have a minimum when they are compared to their correct counterparts.
        
      
      
        <h1>9. Discussion</h1>
        <DRI_Outcome_Contribution agreement="All_Equal">This paper describes an optimization framework for identifying the simulation parameters of cloth from video.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">We captured the behavior of small swatches of fabric using a set of dynamic and static tests and demonstrated that the optimizer could identify appropriate simulation parameters from those tests.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">These parameters produced four distinct and recognizable fabrics when applied to a more complex simulation of a skirt as it was driven by motion capture data from a human figure.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">The cloth model was not the main focus of this research, yet in early versions of the system it was often the bottleneck in achieving appealing results.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">To match a video sequence accurately, the cloth physics model as well as the collision algorithms must be chosen carefully.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">Instabilities in the collision handling will cause perceptible quivering in the motion of cloth.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">Similarly, extra damping introduced by the integration method makes crisp folds impossible to match.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">The parameters must also be independent of the resolution of the mesh so that they can be identified on low resolution swatches and applied to higher resolution garments.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Progress is being made in these areas, however, and cloth models are continually improving.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">For example, Bridson et al. 7 introduces a scale-independent bend model with encouraging results.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">Our cloth model does not diverge significantly from previous models discussed in the literature.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome_Contribution ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">Our only major addition was a simple nonlinearity we introduced into the drag model.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">Hence, our approach should generalize to any parametrized cloth model that produces a sufficiently rich set of physically realistic motions.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">Although the skirt is far more complex than the swatches that were used to determine the parameters, it is not as complex as many garments, for example, a form-fitting pair of pants or a tailored blazer.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">For more complex garments, choosing the parameters via optimization on small, flat swatches may not be sufficient because the shape of the garment is determined by darts, pleats and by the interplay of different fabrics (wool, lining, and interfacing, for example).</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_FutureWork">More complex garments may require the hand design of additional tests that mimic particular behaviors or elements of the garment in isolation.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_FutureWork">Moreover, the model might need extra parameters to handle anisotropic effects, hysteresis and coupling effects (stretching along one direction causing shrinking in the other direction), all of which would need specialized tests.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">En route to the metric used in the experiments described here, we tried a number of other metrics: comparing the overlap of the silhouettes, the distance function between silhouette edges, and using information from internal edges marked on the fabric.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">The metric that measures folds and silhouettes, in concert with the projector for the light stripes, proved to be a simple and effective metric that far outperformed our earlier attempts.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_FutureWork" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">The space of possible metrics is vast, of course, but one class of metrics that we did not experiment with are statistical metrics that compute a function of the shape of the fabric across time rather than evaluating the match on a frame-by-frame basis.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">The experiments with the swatches were carefully controlled to have initial conditions for the simulation that matched those seen in the video.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">If instead, we were to optimize on more complicated garments, then such tight control of the initial conditions is unlikely and a statistical metric might be preferable.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_FutureWork" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">Such a metric might, for example, compute the average number of folds across a time sequence rather than looking for a fold to appear at a particular location on the swatch.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_FutureWork ann2="DRI_FutureWork" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_FutureWork">Our hope is that this work will promote a more rigorous evaluation of various cloth models, especially with respect to how accurately they match reality, and perhaps lead to creation of a standardized set of benchmarks for cloth simulation models.</DRI_FutureWork>

          Figure 16: Validating the estimated parameters on a more complicated motion and garment. We show (from left to right, top to bottom) several frames of an actor skipping while wearing a fleece skirt. The corresponding frames of the skirt in simulation shows that our technique captures the approximate shape and dynamics of the real skirt. These frames were equally spaced across the entire sequence (0.5 seconds apart). The videos in the webpage show the validation results on all four skirts.
