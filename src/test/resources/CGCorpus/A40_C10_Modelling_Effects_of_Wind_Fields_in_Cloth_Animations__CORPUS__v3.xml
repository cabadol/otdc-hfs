      <DRI_Challenge agreement="All_Equal">While the simulation of wind is an area of vast interest in aerodynamic engineering, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and animation/visualisation of fluids in computer graphics, it has been a rather abandoned subject in simulation of deformable objects such as cloth simulation.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Challenge">This is mostly due to the fact that conventional CFD applications require enormous computational power.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Challenge">However, aerodynamic effects are obviously capable of enhancing the realism of an animated scene and thus are an important part of a cloth simulation system.</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge" ann3="DRI_Challenge">For example, air resistance is a vital component which cannot be neglected if realistic animation is desired [ BTH + 03 ].</DRI_Challenge> <DRI_Challenge_Goal ann2="Sentence" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Challenge_Goal" ann3="DRI_Challenge_Goal">In this work we discuss two different approaches to

accounts for external forces.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The first equation states that the velocity field should be incompressible while the second one describes the evolution of a velocity field over time.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The first term on the right hand side reflects the change of velocity due to advection, while the second expression accounts for any external force f and acceleration caused by the local pressure gradient ∇p and by viscous drag depending on ν.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Unspecified ann2="DRI_Approach"

[Sta97].</DRI_Unspecified> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">To solve these equations numerically they first have to be discretised.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">For this, the computational domain is diced up into equally sized cubes forming a grid as described in section 4.2.2, and sample values of velocity and pressure are defined at the cell centres.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Foster and Metaxas [FM96] use a finite difference approximation for the discretisation of the operators in equation (4.2).</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background agreement="All_Equal">Then they update the cell’s velocities according to the divergence value computed in each direction, respectively, using an explicit integration scheme.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Since time steps in explicit computations usually need to be very small, we follow Stam [Sta99] who proposes an implicit integration scheme, which allows stable simulations with large time steps.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">While the linear terms in equation (4.2) are straightforward to solve implicitly, the term −(u · ∇)u is nonlinear

to be satisfied.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">On the other hand, the wind velocity orthogonal to the object’s surface is just what causes the aerodynamic forces.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Without further remedial action setting the boundary according to the Neumann condition would mean that the fluid will not exert forces on the objects.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Here we propose a method which meets both requirements.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">For every deformable object the velocity value of the surrounding wind field for every vertex of the representing mesh is tracked.</DRI_Approach> <Sentence ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="Sentence" ann3="Sentence">In the solver’s cycle, the boundary conditions are then set prior to any other operation: For every object in the scene each triangle of its representing mesh is registered in the fluid grid, which means that the cell of the wind field occupied by the object is marked as occupied.</Sentence> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The wind velocity at the vertex positions of the object is recorded.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Additionally, the normals of these vertices are stored.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Then, the aerodynamic forces as described in section 3 are calculated.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Finally, for every marked cell in the scene the previously stored normals are averaged in one space cell which are used to update the velocity at the cell to satisfy the Neumann boundary condition.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Thus, the boundary conditions are met and yet aerodynamic forces are obtained.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">A different issue is how to deal with the inside of (rigid) objects.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The method to set boundary conditions as described above does not account for the interior of objects.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Thus, a nonzero velocity could be mistakenly assigned to cells lying inside an object.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">To avoid this situation, the path of the wind flow is checked for object intersection, whereby the collision detection of the cloth simulation system provides a simple method to deal with this issue [MKE03].</DRI_Approach> <Sentence agreement="All_Equal">4.2 Particle Tracing on Wind Fields Here we combine the idea of creating wind fields by predefined flow primitives with particle tracing in given flow fields.</Sentence> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">To define a wind scene we first built up the air flow by simple primitives such as parallel directed wind fields, vortices, etc.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">We then use a par- ticle tracing method in

sources corresponding to flow primitives with respective velocity fields w i .</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The field w does not account for lee effects caused by objects in the flow.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Therefore we compute the wind field u containing these effects as follows.</DRI_Approach> <Sentence agreement="All_Equal">In our model every wind source is also a particle source: These particles form an uncoupled particle system which can be considered as a wind gust.</Sentence> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The wind particles are emitted into the velocity field w i of the corresponding wind source which is defined on a grid.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The specific emission intervals and amounts depend on the properties of the flow sources.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">In every time step each particle in a wind gust moves along its velocity field w i defined by the corresponding wind source.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Outcome">Notice that the movement of the particles in a wind gust is only affected by the wind source they belong to.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Background ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="3diff" ann1="DRI_Background" ann3="DRI_Outcome">The global superposition of all wind sources has no effect on these particles.</DRI_Background> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">To calculate the wind particles’ positions we used the explicit Euler integration scheme.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">For a wind particle at position p t and time t this results in a path s(p t , p t+∆t ), where p t+∆t denotes the position after time step ∆t according to p t+∆t = p t + w i (p t , ∆t) .</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">As a particle moves along its path in space, all grid cells colliding with the path are updated with the velocity of the associated wind source with respect to the position of the particle.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The particle might cross several grid cells on its way during a single time step.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">If this is the case, the path of the particle has to be subdivided into parts not exceeding the size of a grid cell.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">This path is then tested for collisions with the objects in the scene.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The velocity field u is then computed as for each grid cell separately, where w i are all those wind sources whose particles have reached the cell.</DRI_Approach> <Sentence agreement="All_Equal">If a collision is detected at position p col the normal of the colliding object n obj (p col ) is determined and the velocity of the particle is set to w i (p col , t+∆t) = w i (p col , t)−(n obj ·w i (p col , t))·n obj This assures that the velocity component of the resulting field u is orthogonal to the collision object’s surface at p col is zero, i.e. u(p col , t + ∆t) · n obj = 0 , and thus no flow propagates through the object.</Sentence> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">The wind force effective on objects in the scene is then computed from the velocity field u.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Since u is determined using the wind particles, every point p that could not be reached by any wind particle will hold zero velocity even if w may hold a nonzero velocity.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Approach" ann3="DRI_Unspecified">Thus, this method solves the problems described in section 4.2.1.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Note that the somewhat tempting simplification of tagging each cell to either have wind in it or not is not valid.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Imagine the simple scene in which there are two directional wind sources with opposite wind directions.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Let them further have equal velocity magnitude and no distance attenuation.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">If we now place a solid object in between these two sources a rather undesired effect would occur using this simplification: on both sides of the solid object all cells would be tagged as having wind.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">But evaluating the wind field at every cell we would obtain a zero velocity.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">This is due to the extinguishing effect of the superposition of the two wind sources.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Approach agreement="All_Equal">Therefore, it is crucial for the particles to have the associated velocity of their wind source and not just the velocity resulting from the global superposition of all wind sources.</DRI_Approach> <Sentence agreement="All_Equal">4.3 Comparison In this section we comment on the different models described in this paper.</Sentence>

        <DRI_Outcome_Contribution agreement="All_Equal">We presented two models for including advanced wind effects into cloth simulation systems.</DRI_Outcome_Contribution> <DRI_Approach ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Approach">The first concentrates on physically accurate computations using a semi-Lagrangian approach to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, the second model incorporates a particle tracing method for global wind fields.</DRI_Approach> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Outcome" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome_Contribution" ann3="DRI_Outcome">As illustrated in the previous section both methods produce realistic looking results which are capable of enhancing the realism of computer animations.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">While the first model has a wider range of applications, the second one provides an easy method which still delivers realistic effects such as air resistance and lee.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome agreement="All_Equal">All methods described in this work should be easy to extend to three-dimensional deformable objects.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">All the methods apply the same except for simple changes.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">Since three-dimensional objects define an inner and outer part, the adaption of the face normals in equation (3.1) is not necessary.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Background" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">Moreover, in the wind field computation care has to be taken that no wind field is present in the object.</DRI_Outcome> <DRI_Outcome ann2="DRI_Approach" agreement="2equal_1diff" ann1="DRI_Outcome" ann3="DRI_Outcome">Here, the same method as described for rigid objects (section 4.2.2) can be applied.</DRI_Outcome>
